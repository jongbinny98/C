This repository contains my school projects for CSE150 (Computer Networking) and CSE130 (Computer Systems Design). These projects highlight foundational concepts and practical applications in networking and system architecture.

üì° CSE150: Computer Networking
In this course, I learned about the architecture of computer networks, including:

The OSI model and usage of protocols such as HTTP, UDP, TCP, and their respective layers.
Basic concepts of computer networking, like protocol selection and communication mechanisms.
Key Project:
Small Building Network Design:
Built a sample network for a four-story building using subnets and switches.
Designed and implemented a firewall to manage traffic, allowing or blocking protocols based on specified restrictions (TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP).

üñ•Ô∏è CSE130: Computer Systems Design
This course bridged networking concepts with practical server development, where I:

Implemented a server to handle application layer communications:
Opened ports and established connections for client-server communication.
Utilized HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to process client requests and return appropriate responses.
