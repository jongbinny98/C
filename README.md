# CSE150 & CSE130 Projects: Networking and Systems Design

This repository contains projects from **CSE150 (Computer Networking)** and **CSE130 (Computer Systems Design)**. 

## CSE150: Computer Networking
- Learned the **OSI model** and protocols like **HTTP, UDP, TCP**, and their layers.
- Designed a **small building network** with subnets and switches.
- Built a **firewall** to allow/block protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, ARP) based on restrictions.

## CSE130: Computer Systems Design
- Built a server to handle **client-server communication** in the **application layer**.
- Implemented HTTP methods (**GET, POST, PUT, DELETE**) for processing client requests and sending responses.
